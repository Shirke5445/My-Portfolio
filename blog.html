<h2>Learn HTML </h2>
<p>HyperText Markup Language or HTML is an important part of most of the web pages and web applications.

    Here, HyperText can be simply understood as “Text within Text.” In more simple words, a text with a link inside can be called a hypertext. This link brings the users to a new webpage, once clicked and thus hypertext is used to link two or more web pages with each other.
    
    Coming to the term Markup Language, one can understand it as a computer language, which is used to make the text more interactive and dynamic, by turning text into images, tables, links, etc. Thus it applies layout and formatting conventions to a text document.
    
    Again when we talk about a web page. It should be clear that we are talking about a web document, and more specifically an HTML document. A web page, in general, can either be of the static or dynamic type and can be identified by entering a URL. However, an HTML web page is a static web page.</p>

<h2>Learn CSS</h2>
<p>  What is CSS 
    Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is a style sheet language. For a document written in the markup language, we can describe the formatting using CSS. To modify the style of an HTML web page and user interface or any XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL, the CSS can be used. <br> <br>
    
      Uses of CSS:
    New looks can be added to an old HTML document.
    A website can be completely modified with only a few changes in the CSS code. <br> <br>
       
     Advantages of CSS:
    We have listed below the three major advantages of CSS:
    
    The tags used for document formatting had to be repeated on every web page before CSS. It was a lengthy process, and thus CSS was created and is recommended to ease the process.
    With CSS, we can modify an entire website by changing just one file because the CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files.
    To specify the display and feel of the website, more detailed attributes are facilitated by CSS than plain HTML. <br> <br>

<h2>Learn Javascript</h2>
<p>JavaScript tutorial for beginners and experienced programmers with examples and output online on Basics, advantages, disadvantages, features, examples, html, dom, css, tags, events, validation, object, loop, array, document and more.
    JavaScript is the most popular programming language. It is lightweight and commonly used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is developed by Netscape in 1995 and named as LiveScript which is later renamed to JavaScript. <br> <br>

    Advantages of JavaScript: <br>
    1. Speed: JavaScript is very fast because it is executed on the client side. <br>
    2. Simplicity: JavaScript is relatively simple and easy to learn. <br>
    3. Versatility: means having a wide variety of skills. JavaScript can be used in a wide variety of applications regardless of the file extension of web pages. <br>
    4. Server Load: As JavaScript executes on the client side it reduce the server load.

<h2>Learn React </h2>
<p>Created by Jordan Walke (a software engineer at Facebook), ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end JavaScript library which can be well characterised as a declarative, efficient, and a flexible one especially for building reusable UI components. It is responsible only for the view layer of the application. Now used in products like WhatsApp & Instagram, Facebook developed ReactJS in 2011 in its news feed section. ReactJS was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and was released to the public in the month of May 2013. <br> <br>

    MVC or model view controller architecture is the most famous for websites nowadays. React is the ‘V’ of the MVC architecture which stands for view. A ReactJS application is known to be a multi-component application. Each component of the ReactJS application is responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code. Being the heart of all React applications, its components can also be nested. This nesting with other components allows the creation of complex applications built of simple building blocks. To fill data in HTML DOM, ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism as it works fast. The virtual DOM only changes individual DOM elements. Thus it does not reload complete DOM every time and is certainly fast.</p>
